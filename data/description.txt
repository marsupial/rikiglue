Contracts of 

The images been transformed with a series of encryption techniques that can be reversed by running an executable and floating its window above the content located at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GspjsTC_j2s&fmt=37.

Keeping it in the family, the application can be downloaded here:
	http://code.google.com/p/rikiglue/downloads/list
The source, including authoring tools, is available, and can be inspected:
	http://code.google.com/p/rikiglue/source/checkout

Further encoded in the frames are instructions that perform a variety of encryption and decryption routines using a set of languages and standards above the decrypted content.

Certain data in the decryption process (including that which is outlined below) has been encrypted with the public key located on the server running https://guggenheim.org/.  A viewer should verify their identity by loading the private key with the "File->Open" menu item.  It is assumed the key will be provided in a format compatible with OpenSSL (v0.98).  If you could document the bureaucratic steps involved in acquiring the private key...that would be a treat.

There is a routine consisting of six instructions that will attempt to replay a series of events which occurred during a Bastille Day in the year of 2010.  These events are seen in the background of the decrypted frames.

Events/instructions did/will modify what is returned during a url request for http://gavinbrown.biz/, as follows:
	move what is currently returned to a new location
	set what will be returned to new content
	move what is currently returned to a new location
	set what is returned to content returned prior to these instructions

These instructions shall most likely be unable to overcome any latency involved in viewing their outcome.  Proving they have again transpired is possible; though left as an exercise for the viewer.  The instructions are not atomic, so any noise you have introduced may cause them to deviate from their intended outcome.

As the viewer was not present for the initial event, http://gavinbrown.biz/mehugsrikrit/ has been created as a small token of commemoration.

There are some eggs involved. They were prepared in a glass that broke during execution. They were consumed anyway, and a reconstruction exists.

There is a fairly large set of platforms and targets involved, so please accept there may be bugs.  I have but one bed, and I not use it properly.
You should be able to reach me through any of the sites listed above minus one.

	Heylo.
	
	Writing non-fiction takes forever and I keep expunging seemingly
	critical words. I also seem to write it to someone who knows my life not
	the least so I apologize if any of this is redundant.
	
	Grossman broke my heart in the summer of '99. Twas sad. I did that whole
	light thing outside her place (ugh, I'm no better than Cusack). One day
	while I was baby sitting it, some guy in possible tweed really likey. I
	believe he worked for the Passerby; in what capacity I don't remember,
	but invited me to an [after]-party at a Galpagos that looked more like
	something from 'Blade in Vietnam', later that week.
	
	I reads up, there was an article in Art Forum about a show
	that featured tons of [small] paintings by tons of painters...It was 99
	so Mr. Brown didn't have the weight of today...Talked a [lengthy] bit
	about him annoying calling Julian Schnabel to put a piece in the show,
	so I was pretty into this figure.
	
	Think I took Corbet with me.  Twead introduced me to Brown at some point
	but I think he was already on to better things in his head, though I
	don't think I was particularly sociable at that time either.  His
	general nature left me pretty sour on the whole art market.  Which kind
	of sucked, as I hadn't even finished school yet, and all it seemed to
	be telling me was I should at least have the possibility of a audience 
	there..He did have a crazy mustache, and Corbet and I either left or spent
	the night referring to him as 'the pirate.'
	
	I was still curious about the shows he was doing, and remember catching
	Tiravanija's apartment, show. There was a stereo inside, and ( placed
	|| left ) CD's.  I wasn't into most (there was actually one really shitty
	techno guy I kept hearing about in Berlin years later)...but hadn't yet
	heard and adored two Smog CD's.  I borrowed them, and have always been
	pissed that it's current state equates to stealing.
	
	I had recently come across the idea of posting them on his website...
	though this is all dependent on whether I can locate said CD's.
	I had hoped to talk about this in person, but it occurs to me Bastille Day
	shall be a wonderful day for such a venture.  Perhaps you can let me know
	if you thought it be best if I not found them?
	
	I truly hope this reaches you in spirits.
	I should mention a blessing comes with a free ski-mask.
